Motivation:
The second leading cause of death among young people is suicide. Every hour and a half, a teen or young adult commits suicide. This loss can be avoided.
Treatment is available to lessen suicidal thoughts and actions after suicidal crises pass. Suicide Safe is a website that can aid people during their difficult times. Primary and behavioral healthcare settings offer individuals at risk of suicide one-of-a-kind opportunities to connect with the healthcare system and gain access to effective treatment.
We have put forward a few features for the website to guide an individual to overcome such beliefs. 
The features include articles on the case study and an anonymous text chat with the professionals. The existing
features like the helpline and awareness among youth and the community help.
This project is a website designed to help every individual who seeks help to overcome their state of mind.

Our goal is to create a suicide prevention website that is efficient, long-lasting, and collaborative. 
It will be used to implement communication strategies based on research that aims to change people's attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge to stop suicide. 
Learn more about the things that keep people from committing suicide and help them get well and recover.
Make suicide prevention a fundamental part of the services provided by health care.
